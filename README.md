# ECM2423-Group-Software-Development-Project

README

This is the prototype version of our application for ECM2423.

The idea of the app is to promote sustainability by setting tasks for your friends to complete across the campus.

Instructions for use:

Prerequisites: 
Using the command line, navigate to the working directory of the project and enter the /mysite/ folder.

Create a superuser using:
Python manage.py createsuperuser

Then run the app using:
Python manage.py runserver

1) Log in and signup

When you first arrive on the home page, press Get Started to set up your account.

For best results, four users are recommended including the previously made super user.

2) Once you’re logged in, you’ll be presented with an option to make a game.

Once you fill out the details, navigate to the Django admin page using your super user credentials.

Navigate to Game/Games to obtain the game code. (This will appear within the app in the final version).

3) Playing the game

With all four users, use the game code to join the lobby on the /game/ path.

Once the fourth user joins you can then click though our demo.
